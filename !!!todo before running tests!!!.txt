ConverterIT.converterTest()
Make shure there are files to be converted. Test fails if there are either 0 files in JSON-folder or all files have already been converted. In second case delete some converted files to test.

JsonDownLoaderIT.downloaderTest()
Could be the same as above(didn't test because too much to download).
Make shure you have an internet connection.
Relatively unrelyable because it may sometimes fail through externel effects even though it's correct.
